# 整理 data schema 的 CSV schema (2025-09-17 05:58Z)

_**User (2025-09-17 01:54Z)**_

把 @https://docs.tardis.dev/downloadable-csv-files#data-types 
中所有 data schema 的 CSV schema (column name, description)
以markdown table的形式 簡潔的整理到 @data-schema-original.md 中

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants me to extract all the CSV schema information (column names and descriptions) from the Tardis.dev documentation page about downloadable CSV files and data types, and organize it into a markdown table format in the `data-schema-original.md` file.


## Understanding User Request  
- The user needs CSV schema information, specifically column names and descriptions, from Tardis.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I need to extract all the CSV schema information from the websearch results and organize it into markdown tables. Let me go through the documentation and extract each data type's schema:


## Extracting CSV Schema

- The task is to gather CSV schema information from websearch results and present it in markdown tables.  
- Focusing on extracting data type schemas, starting with the "increment" type from the documentation.

## Continuing Schema Extraction

- The "incremental_book_L2" schema includes fields like exchange ID, symbol, and timestamps in microseconds since epoch.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I notice that there's an issue with the markdown table formatting. The pipes (|) at the beginning of each line are missing, which would cause the tables to not render properly. I need to fix this by adding the proper markdown table formatting. Let me correct this.</details></think>

Invalid: old_string and new_string are exactly the same.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>It seems the old_string and new_string are exactly the same because I was trying to replace the content with itself. Let me check what the actual current content looks like by reading the file again to see if there are any issues.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I can see the issue now! The markdown tables are missing the opening pipe `|` at the beginning of each line. In markdown, table rows need to start with a pipe character. Let me fix this by adding the missing pipes to all table rows.</details></think>

Invalid: old_string and new_string are exactly the same.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I see the issue - I need to fix the malformed table rows. Looking at the current content, I can see that the table rows are missing the opening pipe. Let me fix this by replacing the malformed table syntax with proper markdown table syntax. I need to be more careful about the exact text I'm replacing.</details></think>

Invalid: old_string and new_string are exactly the same.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I'm making the same mistake again. Let me look at the actual content more carefully. I can see that the lines start with `| Column Name | Description |` but they should start with `| Column Name | Description |`. The issue is that the first character is missing the opening pipe. Let me fix this by replacing the broken table syntax. I need to be more precise about what I'm replacing.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>I keep making the same mistake. Let me look at the raw content again and see exactly what the issue is. Let me read the file again and look at the exact characters.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Now I can see the issue! The table rows start with `||` (double pipes) instead of `|` (single pipe). This is what's breaking the markdown table formatting. I need to fix all instances of `||` at the beginning of table rows and replace them with `|`.
</details></think>

The string to replace was not found in the file.

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Let me try a different approach. I'll replace the file content entirely with the correct markdown formatting. Since the search and replace isn't working due to exact string matching issues, let me create a new version of the entire file with proper formatting.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Perfect! I've successfully extracted all the CSV schema information from the Tardis.dev documentation and organized it into proper markdown tables in the `data-schema-original.md` file. The file now contains:


## Organizing extracted data
- Successfully compiled CSV schema details from Tardis.dev documentation.
- Created and populated `data-schema-original.md` with structured markdown tables.</details></think>

完成！我已經成功從 Tardis.dev 文檔中提取了所有數據類型的 CSV schema 信息，並以簡潔的 markdown 表格格式整理到 `data-schema-original.md` 文件中。

文件現在包含了以下8種數據類型的完整 schema：

1. **incremental_book_L2** - 增量訂單簿 L2 更新
2. **book_snapshot_25** - 25層訂單簿快照  
3. **book_snapshot_5** - 5層訂單簿快照
4. **trades** - 交易數據
5. **options_chain** - 期權鏈數據
6. **quotes** - 報價數據
7. **derivative_ticker** - 衍生品行情數據
8. **liquidations** - 清算數據

每個表格都包含了列名和詳細的描述，所有 markdown 表格格式都已正確設置，可以正常渲染顯示。所有信息都直接來源於您提供的文檔鏈接中的內容。
